            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>
            <img class="white-space-img" src="images/apple.jpg" alt="Apple Site">
            <p>Apple demonstrates a good use of white space on both their mobile and desktop site. White space doesn't
                always have to be "white" - it is just a term used to utilize blank space on a page and shift your
                attention to the main focus. This image has a mostly black/dark background, with only a small amount of
                information - their latest phones name, an image, the cost, and two links to either get more information
                or purchase it. It is very direct/to-the-point and leaves little to no room for distraction or
                confusion. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="alignment">
            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/" target="_blank">The North Face</a>
            <img class="alignment-img" src="images/northface.jpg" alt="North Face Site">
            <p>The North Face follows a consistent center alignment on their mobile site, and a strong left alignment on
                their desktop version. On the mobile version, there is an image/video in the center of the page that
                fills the screen from left to right. While all of the text follows the same center alignment whether
                itâ€™s the small bit of discount information at the top of the image, or the larger text below the image
                talking about a current project The North Face is working on. <br>
                While the desktop version uses the same image/video, this version is left aligned. The North Face logo
                itself is lined up with the text that is displayed as an image overlay. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contrast">
            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <a href="https://www.americafirst.com/" target="_blank">America First Credit Union</a>
            <img class="contrast-img" src="images/bank.jpg" alt="America First Site">
            <p>America First Credit Union uses a good rule of contrast with their site with the colors they have chosen.
                They use a warm orange/yellow to display an image, and a cool contrasting blue for their button to
                obtain more information. They also use a dark and bold solid black background right next to that warm
                orange, with a white text to display an important bit of information about their current status with the
                virus. It is bold and contrasts well. </p>
