        <p>The target audience for UmbrellaOrNot.com are men and women between the ages of 25 and 65. Those that might
            be spending part of their days outside, whether that’s adventuring, walking to work, or just enjoying some
            fresh air. </p>
        
            <h3>Persona One: </h3>
            <p>Sarah Hines - works in New York City, and walks to and from work everyday. She is married
            and has two kids and a dog. They like to spend their free time on walks together at the park. Sarah has a
            masters degree and works at a law firm, making an average of $120,000 a year.
            She will be using her laptop or desktop computer every morning to confirm the weather for the day before she
            leaves for work to know whether or not to carry her umbrella with her. </p>
        <h3>Persona Two:</h3>
            <p>Jacob Johnson - a 65 year old male that is retired and lives in a small town with friendly neighbors. He is
            married, they have a dog and they all go on at least one daily stroll. Every night he checks on his desktop
            computer to see tomorrows weather, and he will set out his umbrella if it’s going to be a rainy or
            particularly sunny day. </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Sarah thinks: Can I make it to work today without my umbrella? 
                </li>
                <li>Sarah: Will I get totally soaked if I take the dog out this morning?</li>
                <li>Sarah: Is it supposed to start raining before I get off work?
                </li>
                <li>Jacob: If I spend the day at the park having a picnic, will it be too hot and I’ll need my umbrella? 
                </li>
                <li>Jacob: It’s freezing this morning, will it be too cold for rain and start to snow?
